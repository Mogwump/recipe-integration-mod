This is mostly for me to keep track of what commits I have made between versions.

### New recipe types:

* Added Alloy Smelter recipes from the mod Alloy Smelter. Currently: Create: TFMG, Energized Power, Eternal Starlight, Extreme Reactors, Ice And Fire Community Edition, Mekanism, Occultism, Silent Gear, Stellaris, The Undergarden

### New mods for existing features:

* Added Autumnity, Create: Northstar - Redux, Silent Gear, Vanilla Backport to: Energized Power Sawmill, Farmer's Delight cutting, Immersive Engineering sawmill, Mekanism Sawmill, Modern Industrialization Cutting Machine. Note: Calorian Planks from Northstar were not added since they do not currently have a recipe
* Added Northstar to: Energized Power Sawmill, Mekanism Sawmill, Modern Industrialization Cutting Machine
* Added some Productive Trees logs to the Energized Power sawmill. More coming soon. (Done 24/162)
* Added Actually Additions lamps to Bumblezone queen bee colour randomizer trades (might add drills in a later update, would probably need to test first because nbt)

### Fixes/Tweaks for existing features:

* Reduced time for Modern Industrialization packer recipes for Farmer's Delight from 10 seconds to 5 seconds
* Added stripped archwood to IE sawmill
* Fixed Productive Trees mod name in energized power sawmill, so the recipes should actually exist now.

### Notes:

Since the last update, I have fixed the links to the github on the Modrinth page so feel free to make mod recommendations!
