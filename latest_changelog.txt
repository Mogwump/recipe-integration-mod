This is mostly for me to keep track of what commits I have made between versions.

New recipe types:

Added Oritech pulverizer recipes. Currently only ore to raw. Currently supported: Ice And Fire Community Edition, Modern Industrialization, Occultism, Useful Foundation, The Undergarden
Added Useful Machinery compacting recipes. Currently: The Undergarden

New mods for existing features:

* Added DivineRPG to Energized Power sawmill recipes
* Added Farmer's Delight to Modern Industrialization packer recipes
* Added Ars Nouveau, Deep Aether, Nature's Spirit, The Aether to Modern Industrialization cutting machine recipes
* Added BOP, BWG, Deep Aether, DivineRPG, Evilcraft, Nature's Spirit, The Aether to Productive Trees sawmill recipes.

Notes:

Versioning whilst in beta will now be 0.x rather than 0.1.x, with the third number being for minor fixes if there are any broken or missing recipes that either I notice or that are reported as an issue on the github.
