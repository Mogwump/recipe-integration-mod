This is mostly for me to keep track of what commits I have made between versions.

New recipe types:

* Added Modern Industrialization macerator recipes (currently: Create, Lands Of Icaria, Occultism)
* Added Immersive Engineering arc furnace recipes (raw block to ingot and ore to ingot). I have only included metal ingots, since the default recipes exclude non-metals. Supported mods: Advent Of Ascension, DivineRPG, GTCEu, Modern Industrialization, Occultism, The Undergarden (uses tags)
Also going to support Industrial Upgrade
* Added Occultism crushing recipes. Currently only raw to dust. Ratios for Gregtech ores are based on the macerator, otherwise 1 raw : 2 dust
* Added Energized Power filtration plant recipes (Create, Immersive Engineering, Mekanism, Occultism (no Iesnium - intentional))
* Added Modern Industrialization packer recipes (currently only for The Undergarden)

New recipes for existing recipe types:

* Added Advent Of Ascension, DivineRPG, Lands Of Icaria, Occultism, The Undergarden to Useful Machinery crushing recipes
* Added remaining Lands Of Icaria ores to Integrated Dynamics squeezer recipes
* Added Integrated Dynamics to Energized Power sawmill recipes
* Added Undergarden ores to Integrated Dynamics squeezer recipes

Misc:

* Various EMC values for several mods
* Tag consistency fixes for GTCEu and Industrial Upgrade (aluminium -> aluminum)
* Some addiional tags for various AE2 p2p attunements
