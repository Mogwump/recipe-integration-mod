This is mostly for me to keep track of what commits I have made between versions.

* Added Umbra Poor Ores water bucket crafting for: The Aether, Forbidden & Arcanus
* Added Clayworks kiln recipes. Currently only smooth sandstones from: Biomes O' Plenty, Nature's Spirit, Oh The Biomes We've Gone, Yung's Cave Biomes
Todo: IE garden cloche (flowers & crops)

### New mods for existing features:

* Added Autumnity, Silent Gear, Vanilla Backport to: Energized Power Sawmill, Farmer's Delight cutting, Immersive Engineering sawmill, Mekanism Sawmill, Modern Industrialization Cutting Machine.
Atmospheric: EP, FD, Mek, MI (partially IE)
* Added Create: Northstar - Redux to: Energized Power Sawmill, Mekanism Sawmill, Modern Industrialization Cutting Machine. Note: Calorian Planks from Northstar were not added since they do not currently have a recipe
* Added some Productive Trees logs to the Energized Power sawmill. More coming soon. (Done 24/162)
* Added Actually Additions lamps to Bumblezone queen bee colour randomizer trades (might add drills in a later update, would probably need to test first because nbt)

### Fixes/Tweaks for existing features:

* Reduced time for Modern Industrialization packer recipes for Farmer's Delight from 10 seconds to 5 seconds
* Reduced time for Oritech pulverizer for silver ores to match existing compat recipes (200 ticks -> 120 ticks, now same as built-in immersive engineering silver)
* Added stripped archwood to IE sawmill
* Fixed Productive Trees mod name in energized power sawmill, so the recipes should actually exist now.
* Fixed recipe ID for GTCEU rubber log stripping with Farmer's Delight

### Notes:

Since the last update, I have fixed the links to the github on the Modrinth page so feel free to make mod recommendations!
