=== CLARIFICATIONS ===

This section is intended to give clarifications for situations where the terms above are ambiguous. The terms above should be followed primarily.

Since this project is almost entirely recipes in data format, if you were to want to add any of these recipes, it would be essentially the exact same. Thus, I do not own the rights to each individual file, but to the project as a whole. Thus, you may use the recipes that I have made in your own mod, but you may not copy and redistribute the entire project, including any modified versions. If you are a developer of one of the mods that I support, you have my explicit permission to add any and all recipes relating to said mod.
